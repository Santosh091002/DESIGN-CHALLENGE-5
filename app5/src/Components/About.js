        <strong>Facing any issues</strong> Throughout our life, it is bound that there are periods of challenges that we must face, but the real challenge is how we grow and learn from overcoming them. Being naive, innocent children, we ignorantly believed that life was going to be simple and effortless. Oh, we were far from correct, we can only dream for life to be that easy. My life, in particular, has been filled with countless, tiring ups and downs. It felt like I was in an endless roller coaster of obstacles. As we mature from being children into adults, we will continue to face countless hurdles that only get bigger and more consequential.
